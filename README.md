# How to use it ?
- First install all the libraries that are used in the script
- Use this command `python ./scrap.py "your_url" "path" "start_name" max_size`
-  `your_url` : the url you want to scrape.
- `path` : path to the folder you want to save your pictures.
- `start_name` : start name of your pictures.
- `max size` : max size of pictures you want (Doesn't guarantee you will have the exact number, maybe you will have less).

# Example :
Scraping car picutres (wanting to have maximum 40 images).
You may note that I had less than 40 images.
